## Introduction
The sample project for using servo motor is called as 'Rlc Resonator.' The project's goal is to make a clear idea about the working of servo motor with its efficiency.And here we are using atmega328 microcontroller for maintaing the threshold.
## Research
### Objective
Rlc Resonatorâ€™s main goal is to show how the working of servo motor with its threshold frequency and below the threshold frequency the motor is at steady state.
### Benefits
* Deeper insight into the servo motor 
* Improve motor efficiency and working
* Monitoring of motor increases the motor life
## Cost and Features
The cost for implementing the project involving cost  from low to high budget. And the features are:
1. Benfits the customers with long efficiency
2. Use of atmega328 gives the correct information of the motor

### Defining Our System
The components in our system are Atmega328 microcontroller,servo motor and and voltage source.When we gives supply to the servo motor an signal is being transmitted to the microcontroller and when its attains the voltage above its threshold frequency its starts the servo motor.
## SWOT ANALYSIS
### Strength:
* Focus and finding more profitable investing customers
* Keeping and maintaining of motors for long time
### Weakness:
* Overload may happens when the microcontroller gets disconnected 
* Lack of proper connection leads to overload and burns the coils
### Opportunities:
* Customer's satisfaction with our motors
* Making better relationship with customers
* Improving customer knowledge on the servo motors with efficiency

### Threats:
* Over automation
* Decreasing personal contact to the motor
## 4W's and 1'H
### Who:
* Sense people knowledge about motor, technical team for safer models and customer support specialist for future works
* Anyone who are with knowledge with the servo motors can access it from companies to customers a large companies as well as small businesses
### What:
* The main purpose of servo motor is to record and give correct values to customer benifits
* Details within the software could include at what threshold the system needs to run
* This makes customer easy to access to the motors for working
### When:
* Organisations and other institutions who wants to make projects and some working models can make use of it
* Come to a great use when finding large customers when they came to know about the use of servo motors
### Where:
* All over the world
### How:
* This program can be executed in a system which has Linux or Windows operating system
